I used class specific keywords extracted from the training dataset (keywords + title + abstract) with a TF-IDF to enhance a HuggingFace PubMedBERT model (microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract-fulltext) adapted to the task by changing the loss function to a BCE one for multi-label classification and running it during 28 epochs with a learning rate of 5e-5.
