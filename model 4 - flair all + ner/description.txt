I used class specific keywords extracted from the training dataset (keywords + title + abstract) with a TF-IDF to enhance a pretrained model called TARS based on the paper "Task-Aware Representation of Sentences for Generic Text Classification" available in the framework Flair adapted to the task for multi-label classification and running it during 10 epochs on Train only with a learning rate of 0.02.
